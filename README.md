PyLuaJITDebugger
================

NOTE: This library is pre-pre-alpha (some might say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph">"aleph"</a>) quality.

PyLuaJITDebugger is a Python library to debug LuaJIT processes and core dumps, without running code in the debuggee.
In contrast to most Lua(JIT) debuggers, PyLuaJITDebugger does not use Lua's debug API nor does it invoke functions in the debuggee process.

For now PyLuaJITDebugger is Windows-only.
